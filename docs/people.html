                Not everyone is talented or lucky enough to become a movie star or musician or have mass mainstream media followings.
                These people that were movie stars, musicians, famous celebrities had thousands of dollars of equipment following
                them and capturing their daily life. Some of these people also controlled what the average person would watch on
                Television. “Everyone has the opportunity and should have the opportunity to be heard” expresses YouTube CEO, Chad
                Hurley. In this ecosystem of YouTube everyone had the opportunity to share videos of themselves to millions of
                people who used the Internet. This was just one of the beginnings of the new form of online media sharing.
                Then came Napster. An online peer to peer network that allowed users to share music. Fanny, the founder of Napster
                thought of this idea out of the necessity of trying to find music on the internet and getting frustrated constantly.
                Napster soon had millions of downloads making it one of the fastest growing applications on the Internet. With the
                sudden rise to fame, Napster found itself in legal issues. Records labels and lawyers saw how Napster was distributing
                copyrighted material for free within their network and were loosing revenue from sales due to it. Bands and artists
                such as Metallica and Dre, despised Napster for distributing their music online for free. Soon this escalated to the
                court room and Napster was told that it had to shut down. Tech giant, Steve Jobs from Apple, took this idea of music
                sharing and made it legal by having to pay for music to be downloaded to devices and be copyrighted at the same
                time. Record labels loved this. However, YouTube found itself in the same situation as Napster and record labels and
                copyrighted material owner were starting to take notice once again. The term Web 2.0 came about during this time of
                YouTube and Napster and was defined as user generated content. User generated content brought the rise of Myspace. A
                website where anyone can create a profile for anyone to see. Millions of people had a Myspace account and soon took
                over google in search results. Another website also rose to popularity during this time called Facebook. Like most
                startups, this company was also started by a college student in their dorm then having to move to Silicon Valley and
                then becoming filthy rich. Now there were two tech giants in this Web 2.0 era. Facebook becoming the long term victor.
                Not everyone was about making millions on the web. In fact, the founder of Craigslist and Wikipedia offer their service
                for free online. Ultimately the Web, became a place for sharing and the new form of communication that everyone used.
