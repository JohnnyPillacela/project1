                <p class="lead">Successful people try to commercialize anything they think they can profit from. Pierre, the founder of eBay, did exactly that with his online auction market. On eBay anyone was able to new or used items and anyone would be able to buy it or place a bid on an auction. On the other hand, there was Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, who sold books online to people everywhere. These two companies were instantly making millions of dollars in revenue every year and the analysts at Wall Street kept an eye out for these companies.
                    Like most tech startups, Jeff Bezos at Amazon focused on getting big fast. Amazon would sacrifice profit just to be able to make revenue and grow even faster. He pretty much didn’t care if he was losing money in the short term as he new it would be big in the future. Analysts also took notice of how big Amazon was becoming in such a short amount of time that they started to doubt Amazon and its power to produce profit. Other analysts looked the other way and thought Amazon is truly the next big thing.
                    Once Amazon and eBay started trading publicly, their owners became billionaires instantly. Their rise to fame and richness inspired many other people to not only invest in their company but also move to Silicon Valley where all the tech startups were happening, and people were getting rich.
                    As millions of people were finding out about how profitable these tech companies can be, they started pouring money into the stock market to any company that had a dot com attached to it. Even more people started investing into these companies stocks as tech companies spent millions in advertisement such as in the Superbowl in 2000.
                    Even more tech startups were emerging because of this and venture capitalists wanting to invest in the next big thing threw money at companies that sometimes didn’t even makes sense investing in. If it was a tech startup, it would be handed money and be traded publicly. It wasn’t too long before people started to speculate the validity of these tech startups and doubt their growth. Inevitably, the stock market crashed, and investors lost millions of dollars. The NYSE and Nasdaq fell and investors were furious at wall street analysts for recommending them to buy into tech startups. The damage was already done and almost 3 trillion dollars disappeared from the stock market.
                    However, some people argue that the dot com bubble was a good thing. Since many tech companies that started up were pretty trash to begin with this left all the strong companies alive and moved the economy forward. In fact, there were now more experienced people who were able to create tech startups as not become a failure. Then came Myspace, Facebook and YouTube.
