                            There was a time when searching stuff on the Internet wasn’t as easy as just going on Google
                            and getting millions of results in seconds. It has to be created and it these tech startups
                            that were creating these search engines had to get funding and some way to make money. When
                            venture capitalists saw how to make money on the Internet, they went to Jerry Yang and David
                            Filo, the co-founders of Yahoo. Jerry and David wanted to advertise on their search engine to
                            millions of their users, but were very skeptical at the time as they thought they would receive
                            a lot of backlash from their users. However, once advertisements were put in place, Yahoo made
                            millions, and no one seemed to care about ads, which spawned many competitors in the search
                            engine game.

                        After a while, these search engines became very entangled and obsessed with the idea of making money
                        and forgot their initial intention of providing meaningful and useful search results to their users.
                        Excite and Google soon become another search engine looking to become the most used search engine
                        on the Internet. Google’s take on their search engine provided a raking system that kept track of
                        how many times a link was clicked on and would show the most clicked link at the top of a search result.
                        One of Excite’s executives saw how vastly better the google search engine was compared to theirs that they
                            wanted google to merge with Excite to take down one of their competitors, Yahoo. No deal was able to be made
                            as Excite couldn’t find a way to profit from search engines like google which only ranked clicks on websites.
                        When a professor at Stanford University saw the opportunity with Google, he introduced them to a wealthy
                        friend of his that would be able to fund Google. Shortly after that, Google was flooded with funds. Google
                        running out of ideas of how to make money needed another source of income. In a meeting with Idealabs
                        CEO, the google founders stole Idealabs idea of paid advertising for links next to the actual results of
                        links and keys that could be sold to advertisers. Idealabs took Google to court for stealing their idea
                        and settled it there for a relatively small price. Ultimately, Google was now making even more money than
                        ever before and decide to take their company public. Shortly after the IPO, the google founders quickly
                        become the worlds richest people. Not stopping and always looking for a way to make more money,
                        Google created many more services that people could use and bought out many other companies that
                        could benefit Google in the long.
